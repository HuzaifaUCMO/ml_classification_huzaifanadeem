# Peer Review of [ml_classification_terry.ipynb](https://github.com/TKonkin/ml-classification-terry/blob/main/ml_classification_terry.ipynb)

## 1. Clarity & Organization
The notebook is well-structured, following a logical progression from project initialization to model training. Each section is clearly numbered and titled, making it easy to navigate. The inclusion of a README with a repeatable workflow enhances clarity.

**Positive Aspects:**
- Clear numbering and titling of sections.
- Detailed README outlining the project's workflow.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Consider adding brief explanations or comments within code cells to provide context for readers unfamiliar with the project.

## 2. Feature Selection & Justification
The notebook outlines the process of choosing features and defining target variables. However, explicit justification for selecting specific features is not provided.

**Positive Aspects:**
- Clear delineation of features and target variables.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Include a rationale for selecting particular features, explaining how they are relevant to the predictive task.

## 3. Model Performance & Comparisons
The notebook details the training of a Decision Tree classifier but does not present performance metrics or comparisons with other models.

**Positive Aspects:**
- Clear steps in training the Decision Tree model.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Compare the Decision Tree's performance with other classifiers, such as Logistic Regression or Random Forest, to provide a comprehensive analysis.

## 4. Reflection Quality
The notebook lacks reflective commentary on challenges faced, insights gained, or potential improvements.

**Positive Aspects:**
- Methodical approach to data processing and model training.

**Suggestions for Improvement:**
- Add a reflection section discussing any obstacles encountered, decisions made during the project, and lessons learned.
- Suggest possible next steps or alternative approaches to enhance the model's performance.
